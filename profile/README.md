This collection of repositories forms the online world of [Rich On Rails](www.richonrails.me).

### Why GitHub?

Hosting blogs and websites on WordPress for so many years you get to find out that it isn't as simple as it looks, maintaining a site, stopping hackers, updating plugins all takes time and effort for which this project doesn't have. 

All the sites within the [Rich On Rails](www.richonrails.social) "universe" make use of static website generators, mainly [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and are hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for simplicity. 

### Publication

Sites are updated using [Netlify's](https://www.netlify.com/) GitHub CI workflow, when a change gets committed to main be that directly or via a pull request, the site will get rebuilt and deployed without having to generate any files, open any FTP or change any configuration files because some plugin decided to make a breaking change.
