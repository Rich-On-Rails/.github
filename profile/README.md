This collection of repositories forms the online world of Rich On Rails.

### Why GitHub?

Hosting blogs and websites on WordPress for so many years you get to find out that it isn't as simple as it looks, maintaining a site, stopping hackers, updating plugins all takes time and effort for which this project doesn't have. 

All the sites within the Rich On Rails "universe" make use of static website generators, mainly Hugo and are hosted on Netlify for simplicity. 

### Publication

Sites are updated using Netlify's GitHub CI workflow, when a change gets committed to main be that directly or via a pull request, the site will get rebuilt and deployed without having to generate any files, open any FTP or change any configuration files because some plugin decided to make a breaking change.
